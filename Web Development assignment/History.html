	<p style="color:white;overflow: hidden;margin-top: 20px;">China is the home of one of the world’s oldest civilisations, but it has only recently become a ‘modern’ nation. In the last 20 years, China has changed faster than any other country in the world. n Chinese history can be divided into three main periods: the Feudal Period (221 BC–1911 AD), the Republic of China Period, and the People's Republic of China Period. This summary focuses on the Feudal Period and its technological innovations.The Feudal Period began with the establishment of the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC and lasted over two millennia until the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911. Unlike the United States, which developed as a free-market economy from its inception in 1776, China's evolution during this period was characterized by a feudal society structure, and historians debate its historical trajectory.Technological advancements during the Feudal Period can be divided into two phases. The first phase, from 221 BC to 1279 AD, witnessed significant progress in innovation and technology, while the second phase, from 1279 AD to 1911 AD, saw a decline in technological advancement and economic prosperity compared to Western nations.</p>
